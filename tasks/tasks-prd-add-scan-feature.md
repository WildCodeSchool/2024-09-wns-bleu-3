### Notes

- Follow TDD approach: write tests before implementing functionality.
- All tests should be run using `npm test` from within the frontend or backend directories.
- The frontend uses React 19, Vite, TypeScript, ShadCN UI, and Tailwind CSS.
- The backend uses TypeScript, GraphQL (via type-graphql) with GraphQL Yoga/Express, and TypeORM.
- Authentication is handled via the context object (`ContextType`) which contains user ID if authenticated.
- For GraphQL codegen, run `npx graphql-codegen --config codegen.ts` from the frontend directory.
- Remember to consider both light theme (dashboard) and dark theme (homepage) when styling components.
